# Textblook

Textblook was created to enable students to buy and sell textbooks with other students on campus.  Textblook was developed using the Django web framework.  As of now, only the University of Minnesota is being supported in development.  All textbooks are preloaded into the database after scraping the University of Minnesota's textbook website.  Users can not add new books but can make post for the textbooks available for that particular semester.  Tetxblook as of now only allows users to sign in via Facebook and during the registrtion process students must provide their university email and their Facebook username.
